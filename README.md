During our end of study project, we had to realize a gas detector robot with the following specifications.  
The objective of this project was to transform a robot previously built at the IUT into a robot able to move in a known environment and detect something.
We completed the specifications with the following functions: 
- To create a mobile robot with the aim of finding the origin of a gas on a known 
        and report it to the user by an email.
- The robot must be derived from a pre-existing robot base and provided by the IUT.
- The robot will be powered by battery (2 x 12V)
- It must have a gas and/or smoke detection mechanism
- It will have to use a Wi-Fi system to transmit the alert information via an email.
- It will have to follow a predefined path by a black band on the ground.
- It shall transmit a photo/video via a camera of the gas/smoke detection area. 
         of gas/smoke.
- He will have to stop his route as soon as he arrives in his storage area (end of 
        end of the route)
- He will have to stop his route if he meets an obstacle
